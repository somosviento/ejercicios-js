# Exercise 1: Todo List App

## Objective
Build a simple Todo List application using React that allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks.

## Requirements
1. Create a form to add new todo items
2. Display a list of todo items
3. Each todo item should have:
   - A checkbox to mark it as completed
   - A delete button to remove it
   - Text styling that changes when the item is completed (e.g., strikethrough)
4. Implement the functionality to:
   - Add new todos
   - Toggle todo completion status
   - Delete todos

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to this directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open the code in your favorite editor

## Tips
- Use React's useState hook to manage the list of todos
- Each todo item should have at least an id, text, and completed status
- Break your application into components (e.g., TodoForm, TodoItem, TodoList)
- Focus on functionality first, then improve the styling

## Bonus Challenges
- Add local storage to persist todos between page refreshes
- Add the ability to edit existing todos
- Implement filtering (All, Active, Completed)
- Add a "Clear Completed" button

## Solution
Check the `/solution` folder for a reference implementation after you've completed your own version.
