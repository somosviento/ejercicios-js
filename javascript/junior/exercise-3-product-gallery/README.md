# Exercise 3: Product Gallery

## Objective
Build a product gallery application using React that displays a list of products, allows filtering by category, and implements a simple search functionality.

## Requirements
1. Display a grid of products with:
   - Product image
   - Product name
   - Product price
   - Product category
2. Implement filtering functionality:
   - Allow users to filter products by category
   - Include an "All Products" option to show all products
3. Implement search functionality:
   - Allow users to search for products by name
   - Update the displayed products in real-time as the user types

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to this directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open the code in your favorite editor

## Tips
- Use React's useState hook to manage the list of products, selected category, and search query
- Create separate components for the product list, product item, filter, and search
- Use array methods like filter() to implement the filtering and searching functionality
- Focus on functionality first, then improve the styling

## Bonus Challenges
- Add sorting options (by price, name, etc.)
- Implement a "Add to Cart" feature with a cart counter
- Add product details view when clicking on a product
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop views

## Solution
Check the `/solution` folder for a reference implementation after you've completed your own version.
