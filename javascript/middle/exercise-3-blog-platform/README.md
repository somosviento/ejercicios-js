# Exercise 3: Blog Platform

## Objective
Build a blog platform that allows users to view blog posts, read individual posts, add comments, and filter posts by category or search by keyword. This exercise focuses on routing, data fetching, and state management.

## Requirements
1. Blog Post List:
   - Display a list of blog posts with title, excerpt, author, and date
   - Implement pagination (previous/next or load more)
   - Show featured image for each post
2. Single Post View:
   - Display full post content with formatting
   - Show author information and publication date
   - Display existing comments
   - Allow users to add new comments
3. Filtering and Search:
   - Filter posts by category
   - Search posts by keyword
   - Sort posts by date or popularity
4. Routing:
   - Implement client-side routing using React Router
   - Create routes for home, post list, single post, and categories

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to this directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open the code in your favorite editor

## Tips
- Use React Router for navigation between pages
- Consider using a mock API or JSON file for blog data
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Use React hooks for state management
- Create reusable components for post cards, comments, etc.

## Bonus Challenges
- Add user authentication (mock)
- Implement a "like" or "bookmark" feature for posts
- Add a rich text editor for comments
- Create an admin interface for creating and editing posts
- Implement client-side caching for better performance
