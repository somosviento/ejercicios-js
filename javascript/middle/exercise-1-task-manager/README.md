# Exercise 1: Task Manager

## Objective
Build a task management application using React that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, organize them into projects, and track their status and priority. This exercise introduces the React Context API for state management.

## Requirements
1. Task Management:
   - Create new tasks with title, description, due date, and priority
   - Edit existing tasks
   - Delete tasks
   - Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
2. Project Organization:
   - Create different projects to organize tasks
   - Assign tasks to specific projects
   - View tasks filtered by project
3. State Management:
   - Use React Context API to manage application state
   - Implement reducers for handling different actions
4. UI Features:
   - Display tasks in a list view with sorting options
   - Show task details in a modal or separate view
   - Implement a responsive design

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to this directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open the code in your favorite editor

## Tips
- Plan your data structure before starting to code
- Break down the application into reusable components
- Use the Context API to avoid prop drilling
- Consider using the useReducer hook for complex state logic
- Implement proper form validation for task creation/editing

## Bonus Challenges
- Add drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks
- Implement task filtering by status, priority, and due date
- Add data persistence using localStorage
- Create a dashboard with task statistics and charts
- Add user authentication (mock)
